# Track- Myspend 🤑


A fun (and maybe not-so-useful) budget tracker to keep an eye on your expenses! This tracker includes some truly "unique" features that probably won't help you manage your budget but are here to add a little humor to your financial journey.

Features:-
Functional
Add Income & Expenses: Keep track of where your money is going and where it’s coming from.

View Spending Summary: See how much you’ve spent and saved over time.

Categorize Transactions: Sort your expenses by categories like "Food," "Rent," "Entertainment," etc.


Useless

Random Fortune for Every Expense: After logging an expense, get a random fortune like "Money is temporary, but so is happiness" to make you reflect.

Savings “Motivator”: This feature pretends to calculate how much you could save in a year by not spending, but it always rounds to zero (to keep you realistic).

Automatic Compliment Generator: Every time you log an expense, you get a compliment on your spending habits, no matter how poor they may be.

Personal Finance Trivia: Occasionally, the app will pop up with random trivia like “Did you know? You’d be a millionaire if you saved every penny since birth!” to keep you "motivated."

Seasonal Spending Advice: Recommends irrelevant seasonal advice like “It's summer! Save on electricity by turning off your fridge".
